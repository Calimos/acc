**2017.1.27 (201801270)**
- General optimizations
- Minor cosmetic changes
- Stability improvements
- Updated cs service function

*Release Note*
- Unsupported devices whose owners already provided a debug zip won't be supported anytime soon. Most, if not all of those lack advanced charging control functionality -- custom kernel [or proper hardware] required.


**2017.1.25 (201801250)**
- Fixed installation error -- A/B partition devices
- General optimizations
- Updated control files database


**2017.1.13 (201801130)**
- Extended (loops) verbose -- toggle: `cs -v`
- Fixed hang/reboot upon charger connection
- Fixed Nexus 10 compatibility issues
- Major optimizations
- Support for virtually all Magisk versions to date (special downgrading procedures no longer needed)

*Release Note*
- Current settings will be reverted to defaults.


**2017.12.31 (201712310)**
- General optimizations
- `cs -x` -- pick a different charging switch from the database
- `cs -x /path/to/switch` -- manually set the charging switch; refer to the README for additional info
- Updated charging switches database

*Release Note*
- If charging control is inconsistent, run `cs -x` to pick a different switch from the database.


**2017.12.30-1 (201712301)**
- Fixed permission issues & unexpected reboot upon initial setup
- General optimizations
- Updated debugging engine & charging switches database

*Release Notes*
- Bootloop? Run `touch /data/.xcs` as root before installing. Unless you clear /data or I change the key, this flag is only needed once.
- `cs -x` -- run it once if charging doesn't stop. Refer to the README for details.


**2017.12.30 (201712300)**
- Better compatibility (devices & Magisk)
- `cs -x` is back -- run it once if charging doesn't stop. Refer to the README for details.
- General optimizations
- New and enhanced debugging engine
- Updated charging switches database
- Wait for charger before initial setup instead of just reminding the user to plug it in.

*Release Notes*
- 3rd call: owners of "still unsupported devices", please upload new debugging data. Reverse engineering this stuff can take a while. The sooner you provide me the data, the closer you'll be to having your devices supported.
- Bootloop? Run `touch /data/.xcs` as root before installing. Unless you clear /data or I change the key, this flag is only needed once.
- Current settings will be reverted to defaults.


**2017.12.24 (201712240)**
- `cs -s` & `cs -s --enable/disable` -- toggle pause/resume & enable/disable service
- Enhanced device compatibility assessment
- General optimizations
- Minor cosmetic changes
- New charging control algorithm (automatically cycles through available control files to make sure charging is enabled/disabled; `cs -x` is officially dead)

*Release Notes*
- 2nd call: owners of "still unsupported devices", please upload new debugging data. Reverse engineering this stuff can take a while. The sooner you provide me the data, the closer you'll be to having your devices supported.
- Current settings will be reverted to defaults.


**2017.12.22 (201712220)**
- Magisk v14.6 support
- Enhanced `cs debug`
- Installer verbose always ON
- Top to bottom optimizations
- Updated control files database

*Release Notes*
- `cs -x` switches between available control files for supported devices. For instance, Samsung devices have `store_mode` & `batt_slate_mode`; stock/near-stock Android smartphones have `charging_enabled` & `battery_charging_enabled`. Use the command only in case of charging control inconsistencies.
- Owners of "still unsupported devices", please install this version and upload a new debug zip/log generated by it.


**2017.12.20 (201712200)**
- Core optimizations
- `cs -b` -- clear battery stats on demand

- Default settings are now 90 80 for best convenience
- Fixed control files ID mechanism setting more than one switch in certain cases
- Fixed `cs -h` (help) not working on unsupported devices
- Updated reference

*Release Notes*
- Bootloop? "cs not found"? -- Run `touch /data/b /data/r` prior to installing.
- Due to major incompatibilities between @MCMotherEffin''s work ethics & style and those of mine, he's no longer a collaborator.
- Current settings will be reverted to defaults.
- If charging control is inconsistent, try `cs -x`.
- You may want to run `cs -h` or check the README for new/extra usage tips.


**2017.12.16 (201712160)**
- Default cs path reverted to /system/xbin -- in case bootloop or "cs not found" issues occur, change to bin by running `su -c touch /data/b` prior to installing
- Fixed ModPath searcher not filtering out '/vendor'
- Portability & compatibility improvements
- Updated control files database -- reverse engineering


**2017.12.15-2 (201712152)**

**2017.12.15-1 (201712151)**
- Initial setup improvement -- install, connect charger, reboot, configure (or leave defaults: 90 10) and forget
- Updated reference


**2017.12.15 (201712150)**
- Fixed "cs not found", "charging not stopping", bootlooping, "syntax error" issues & more
- Flash same version again to uninstall
- Better compatibility with legacy shells
- Massive optimizations
- More accurate charging control
- More robust get_ctrl_files function
- `touch /data/x` before flashing moves cs from bin (default) to xbin dir -- may be useful when cs trips SafetyNet or causes a bootloop
- Updated ctrl_files_db & reference

*Release Comments/Notes*
- All data generated by previous CS versions will be wiped.
- First run (setup) -- battery MUST be charging for cs to correctly identify & test control files.
- If a device has more than one known charging control file, cs will test them all to verify whether at least one of those truly works.
- Settings will be reverted to defaults (90 10).


**2017.12.12 (201712120)**
- Fixed charging  not working properly after changing % limit values while CS service is running
- Fixed control file ID engine not parsing its database entirely (limited to "battery/charging_enabled" control file) 
- Fixed missing built-in zip binary path
- Updated debugging tools
 
 
**2017.12.11 (201712110)**
- `cs -c` on steroids -- manually set control file config -- syntax: `cs -c /path/to/ctrl/file ON OFF`
- CS service ignitor no longer in zzz-cs-service directory
- Documentation available in /data/media/cs/info
- Enhanced debugging resources/tools -- `cs debug` & verbose logging (toggle: `cs -v`, default OFF)
- Fixed charging control not working in-between/outside set % limits
- Fixed lag/memory leak issues
- Full Magisk 14.5 support
- Massive reduction in RAM consumption
- New charging control & uevent files identication engine -- wider device compatibility & easier/faster debugging
- No more "garbage" generation
- Root check -- reminder to run cs as root
- Updated reference -- it's about time to befriend `cs -h`

*Release Comments/Notes*
- All data generated by previous CS versions will be wiped.
- [NEW FEATURE] cs has a `charging control files database` ($ModPath/config/ctrl_files_db) and it can be updated separately -- no rebooting necessary.
- Settings will be reverted to defaults (90 10).
- Unfortunately, a couple of devices (i.e., ASUS Zenfone 2, BLU R1 HD, TECNO L9 PLUS) have [very] odd/non-intuitive charging control files. I've been working on reverse engineering to figure out how to disable charging on such targets. I'm afraid a couple of these phones don't even support that feature. As long as cs development is up, I'll keep diving deeper into this, though.
