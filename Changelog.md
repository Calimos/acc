# 2017.12.15-1 (201712151)
- Initial setup improvement -- install, connect charger, reboot, configure (or leave defaults: 90 10) and forget
- Updated reference


# 2017.12.15 (201712150)
- Fixed "cs not found", "charging not stopping", bootlooping, "syntax error" issues & more
- Flash same version again to uninstall
- Better compatibility with legacy shells
- Massive optimizations
- More accurate charging control
- More robust get_ctrl_files function
- `touch /data/x` before flashing moves cs from bin (default) to xbin dir -- may be useful when cs trips SafetyNet or causes a bootloop
- Updated ctrl_files_db & reference

**Release Comments/Notes**
- All data generated by previous CS versions will be wiped.
- First run (setup) -- battery MUST be charging for cs to correctly identify & test control files.
- If a device has more than one known charging control file, cs will test them all to verify whether at least one of those truly works.
- Settings will be reverted to defaults (90 10).


# 2017.12.12 (201712120)
- Fixed charging  not working properly after changing % limit values while CS service is running
- Fixed control file ID engine not parsing its database entirely (limited to "battery/charging_enabled" control file) 
- Fixed missing built-in zip binary path
- Updated debugging tools
 
 
# 2017.12.11 (201712110)
- `cs -c` on steroids -- manually set control file config -- syntax: `cs -c /path/to/ctrl/file ON OFF`
- CS service ignitor no longer in zzz-cs-service directory
- Documentation available in /data/media/cs/info
- Enhanced debugging resources/tools -- `cs debug` & verbose logging (toggle: `cs -v`, default OFF)
- Fixed charging control not working in-between/outside set % limits
- Fixed lag/memory leak issues
- Full Magisk 14.5 support
- Massive reduction in RAM consumption
- New charging control & uevent files identication engine -- wider device compatibility & easier/faster debugging
- No more "garbage" generation
- Root check -- reminder to run cs as root
- Updated reference -- it's about time to befriend `cs -h`

**Release Comments/Notes**
- All data generated by previous CS versions will be wiped.
- [NEW FEATURE] cs has a `charging control files database` ($ModPath/config/ctrl_files_db) and it can be updated separately -- no rebooting necessary.
- Settings will be reverted to defaults (90 10).
- Unfortunately, a couple of devices (i.e., ASUS Zenfone 2, BLU R1 HD, TECNO L9 PLUS) have [very] odd/non-intuitive charging control files. I've been working on reverse engineering to figure out how to disable charging on such targets. I'm afraid a couple of these phones don't even support that feature. As long as cs development is up, I'll keep diving deeper into this, though.
