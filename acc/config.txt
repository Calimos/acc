# Change this only if your system reports incorrect battery capacity ("acc -i" (BMS) vs "dumpsys battery" (system)).
capacityOffset=+0

# This is an alternative to capacityOffset. It tells acc whether the battery capacity reported by Android should be updated every few seconds to reflect the actual value from the battery management system.
capacitySync=false

# <coolDown-pauseCharging_waitSeconds> - <waitSeconds> allow battery temperature to drop below <pauseCharging>. Temperature values are interpreted in Celsius degrees. To disable temperature control entirely, set absurdly high temperature values (e.g., temperature=90-95_90).
temperature=40-45_90

# Charge/pause ratio in seconds (e.g., coolDownRatio=50/10) - reduces battery stress induced by prolonged high temperature and high charging voltage by periodically pausing charging. If charging is too slow, turn this off (null value) or change the ratio. When set to null, <coolDown capacity> and <coolDown temperature> values are nullified.
# Generally, you don't need this if you're limiting the maximum charging voltage.
